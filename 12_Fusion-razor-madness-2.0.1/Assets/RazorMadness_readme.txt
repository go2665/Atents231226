    The Razor Madness Demo uses Photon Fusion and the Photon Cloud.
    A free account for the Photon Cloud is needed (to use the online matchmaking and fallback relay).

    The "Photon Fusion Hub" window should pop up when you open the demo in the Editor for the first time.
    This will guide you to create the needed Fusion AppId.

    In short:
    - Sign in or register on: https://dashboard.photonengine.com
    - Create an app of type Fusion
    - Copy and paste the AppId into the PhotonAppSettings scriptable object (or the Fusion Hub window)
